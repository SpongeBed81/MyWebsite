  <h1>What I Do</h1>
  <p>SpongeBed. 14 y/o developer and innovator</p>
  <p>
    I'm a software developer passionate about delivering quality in
    user-friendly experiences. <br /> Currently, my team and I are developing
    <a href="https://openani.me">OpenAnime</a>, a top-notch anime platform aimed
    <br /> at providing the best viewing experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have 3 years of experience in programming and I generally use JavaScript
    and C# in my projects. <br /> Also, I use Svelte as my main frontend framework.
  </p>
  <p>In my free time, I love talking about programming and improving myself.</p>
